    "PyTorch is a machine learning library, like TensorFlow. At its core, PyTorch provides an interface for creating and manipulating [tensors](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html), which are data structures that you can think of as multi-dimensional arrays. Tensors are represented as n-dimensional arrays of base datatypes such as a string or integer -- they provide a way to generalize vectors and matrices to higher dimensions. PyTorch provides the ability to perform computation on these tensors, define neural networks, and train them efficiently.\n",

    "The [```shape```](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.shape.html#torch.Tensor.shape) of a PyTorch tensor defines its number of dimensions and the size of each dimension. The `ndim` or [```dim```](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.dim.html#torch.Tensor.dim) of a PyTorch tensor provides the number of dimensions (n-dimensions) -- this is equivalent to the tensor's rank (as is used in TensorFlow), and you can also think of this as the tensor's order or degree.\n",
